Game

Title

Title should be written in TitleCase (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Title_case) and in the english version. Region variant are not handled (yet?) which means default version are most of the time the US version of a game. Title should reflect that.

Example: Shadow of the Colossus.

Different edition (not variant) should reflect that in the title. Edition should be added in the title between brackets `[]`. 

Example: 
Shadow of the Colossus [Greatest Hits] (https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=68780)
The House of the Dead 2 [Sega All Stars] (https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=73241)
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D [Nintendo Selects] (https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=73263)
Star Fox Zero [First Print Edition] (https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=39333)

For non english released, like games only released in Japan, the title should be in the original language, and use Alt names to propose english/international version of the title.

Example:
Jump Superstars (https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=27192) for Nintendo DS have only be released in Japan, so the entry title should be ジャンプスーパースターズ. 
To help for search, Alt names should contains the English and/or Hepburn version of the title: Jump Super Stars

Alt names

Alternatives names should be added in order to help search for title variations.
For example title containing roman numerals, like Final Fantasy VII can add alternate titles with international numerals, ie: Final Fantasy 7. It can also be used to add well known abreviations, ie: FF7.
